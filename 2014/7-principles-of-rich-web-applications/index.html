They are the result of my experience as a web developer, but also as a long-time user of the WWW.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">JavaScript has undeniably become an indispensable tool for frontend developers. Its usage is now expanding into other areas like <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">servers</a> and <a href="https://tessel.io/" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">microcontrollers</a>.

Server rendered pages are not optional</h2></div><div class="jsx-4153657131 wrap"><b class="jsx-4153657131">tl;DR:</b> <div class="jsx-4153657131 content">Server rendering is not about SEO, it’s about performance. Consider the additional roundtrips to get scripts, styles, and subsequent API requests. In the future, consider HTTP 2.0 “pushing” of resources.</div></div><p class="jsx-4038270940">The first thing I’m compelled to point out is a fairly common false dichotomy. That of “server-rendered apps vs single-page apps”. If we want to optimize for the best possible user experience and performance, giving up one or the other is never a good idea.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">The reasons are fairly straightforward. The medium by which pages are transmitted, the internet, has a theoretical speed limit. This has been memorably illustrated by the famous essay/rant <a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/latency.html" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">“It’s the latency, stupid”</a> by Stuart Cheshire:</p><pre class="jsx-815773015"><code class="jsx-815773015">The distance from Stanford to Boston is 4320km.
The speed of light in vacuum is 300 x 10^6 m/s.
The speed of light in fibre is roughly 66% of the speed of light in vacuum.
The speed of light in fibre is 300 x 10^6 m/s * 0.66 = 200 x 10^6 m/s.
The one-way delay to Boston is 4320 km / 200 x 10^6 m/s = 21.6ms.
The round-trip time to Boston and back is 43.2ms.
The current ping time from Stanford to Boston over today’s Internet is about 85ms (…)
So: the hardware of the Internet can currently achieve within a factor of two of the speed of light.</code></pre><p class="jsx-4038270940">The cited 85ms round-trip time between Boston and Stanford will certainly improve over time, and your own experiments right now might already show it. But it’s important to note that there’s a theoretical minimum of about <strong class="jsx-4160647468">50ms</strong> between the two coasts.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">The bandwidth capacity of your users’ connections might improve noticeably, as it steadily has, but the latency needle won’t move much at all. This means that minimizing the number of roundtrips you make to display information on page is essential to great user experience and responsiveness.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">This becomes particularly relevant to point out considering the rise of JavaScript-driven applications that usually consist of no markup other than <code class="jsx-4056748551">&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code class="jsx-4056748551">&lt;link&gt;</code> tags beside an empty <code class="jsx-4056748551">&lt;body&gt;</code>. This class of application has received the name of “Single Page Applications” or “SPA”. As the name implies, there’s only one page the server consistently returns, and all the rest is figured out by your client side code.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">Consider the scenario where the user navigates to <code class="jsx-4056748551">http://app.com/orders/</code> after following a link or typing in the URL. At the time your application receives and processes the request, it already has important <em class="jsx-4160647468">information</em> about what’s going to be shown on that page. It could, for example, pre-fetch the orders from the database and include them in the response. In the case of most SPAs, a blank page and a <code class="jsx-4160647468">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is returned instead, and another roundtrip will be made to get the scripts contents. So that then another roundtrip can be made to get the data needed for rendering.</p><div class="jsx-2740946856 "><div class="jsx-3393864610"><img src="https://cldup.com/kpfLbf6dha.png" class="jsx-3393864610"/></div><p class="jsx-2740946856">Analysis of the HTML sent by the server for every page of a SPA in the wild</p></div><p class="jsx-4038270940">At this point many developers consciously accept this tradeoff because they make sure the extra network hops happen only once for their users by sending the proper cache headers in the script and stylesheet responses. The general consensus is that it’s an acceptable tradeoff because once the bundle is loaded, you can then handle most of the user interaction (like transitions to other pages) without requesting additional pages or scripts.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">However, even in the presence of a cache, there’s a performance penalty when considering script parsing and evaluation time. <a href="http://modernweb.com/2014/03/10/is-jquery-too-big-for-mobile/" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">“Is jQuery Too Big For Mobile?”</a> describes how even for jQuery alone this could be in the order of hundreds of milliseconds for certain mobile browsers.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">What’s worse, usually no feedback whatsoever is given to the user while the scripts are loading. This results in a blank page displaying and then a sudden transition to a fully loaded page.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">Most importantly, we usually forget that the current prevailing transport of internet data (TCP) <em class="jsx-4160647468">starts slowly</em>. This pretty much guarantees that most script bundles won’t be fetched in one roundtrip, making the situation described above even worse.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">A TCP connection starts with an initial roundtrip for the handshake. If you’re using SSL, which happens to be important for safe script delivery, an additional two roundtrips are used (only one if the client is resuming a session). Only then can the server start sending data, but as it turns out, it does so slowly and incrementally.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">A congestion control mechanism called <em class="jsx-4160647468">slow start</em> is built into the TCP protocol to send the data in a growing number of <em class="jsx-4160647468">segments</em>. This has two serious implications for SPAs:</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">1. Large scripts take a lot longer to download than it seems. As explained in the book <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch02.html#thats_four_rou" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">“High Performance Browser Networking”</a> by Ilya Grigorik, it takes “four roundtrips (…) and hundreds of milliseconds of latency, to reach 64 KB of throughput between the client and server”. In this example, considering a great internet connection between London and New York, it takes 225ms before TCP is able to reach the maximum packet size.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">2. Since this rule applies also for the initial page download, it makes the initial content that comes rendered with the page all that much more important. As Paul Irish concludes in his presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MtDBNTH1g7CZzhwlJ1raEJagA8qM3uoV7ta6i66bO2M/present#slide=id.g3eb97ca8f_10" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">“Delivering the Goods”</a>, the first 14kb are crucially important. This is a helpful illustration of the amount of data the server can send in each round-trip over time:</p><div class="jsx-2740946856 "><div class="jsx-3393864610"><img src="https://cldup.com/WI9kN_9iyR.png" class="jsx-3393864610"/></div><p class="jsx-2740946856">How many KB a server can send for each phase of the connection by segments</p></div><p class="jsx-4038270940">Websites that deliver content (even if it’s only the basic layout without the data) within this window will seem extremely responsive. In fact, to many authors of fast server-side applications JavaScript is deemed unneeded or as something to be used sparingly. This bias is further strengthened if the app has a fast backend and data sources and its servers located near users (CDN).</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">The role of the server in assisting and speeding up content presentation is certainly application-specific. The solution is not always as straightforward as “render the entire page on the server”.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">In some cases, parts of the page that are not essential to what the user is likely after are better left out of the initial response and fetched later by the client. Some applications, for example, opt to render the “shell” of the page to respond immediately. Then they fetch different portions of the page in parallel. This allows for great responsiveness even in a situation with slow legacy backend services. For some pages, pre-rendering the content that’s “above <a href="https://varvy.com/pagespeed/prioritize-visible-content.html" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">the fold</a>” is also a viable option.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">Making a <em class="jsx-4160647468">qualitative assessment</em> of scripts and styles based on the information the server has about the the session, the user and the URL is absolutely crucial. The scripts that deal with sorting orders will obviously be more important to <code class="jsx-4056748551">/orders</code> than the logic to deal with the settings page. Maybe less intuitively, one could also make a distinction between “structural CSS” and the “skin/theme CSS”. The former might be required by the JavaScript code, so it should block, but the latter could be loaded asynchronously.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">A neat example of a SPA that does not incur in extra roundtrip penalties is a proof-of-concept clone of <a href="http://danlec.com/blog/stackoverflow-in-4096-bytes" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">StackOverflow in 4096 bytes</a> (which can theoretically be delivered on the first post-handshake roundtrip of a TCP connection!). It manages to pull this off at the expense of cacheability, by inlining all the assets within the response. With <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/link-headers-and-server-hint" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">SPDY or HTTP/2 server push</a>, it should be theoretically possible to deliver client code that’s cacheable in a single hop. For the time being, rendering part or all of the page on the server is the most common solution to avoiding extra roundtrips.</p><div class="jsx-2740946856 "><div class="jsx-3393864610"><img src="https://cldup.com/NeV5qFDaVR.png" class="jsx-3393864610"/></div><p class="jsx-2740946856">Proof-of-concept SPA with inlined CSS and JS that doesn’t incur in extra roundtrips</p></div><p class="jsx-4038270940">A flexible enough system that can share rendering code between browser and server and provides tools for progressively loading scripts and styles will probably eliminate the colloquial distinction between <em class="jsx-4160647468">websites and webapps</em>. Both are reigned by the same UX principles. A blog and a CRM are fundamentally not that different. They have URLs, navigation, they show data to the user. Even a spreadsheet application, which traditionally relies a lot more on client side functionality, first needs to show the user the data he’s interested in modifying. And doing so in the least number of network roundtrips is paramount.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">In my view, the major tradeoffs in performance seen in many widely deployed systems these days have to do with the progressive accumulation of complexity in the stack. Technologies like JavaScript and CSS were added over time. Their popularity increased over time as well. Only now can we appreciate the impact of the different ways they’ve been applied. Some of this is addressed by improving protocols (as shown by the ongoing enhancements seen in SPDY and QUIC), but the application layer is where most of the benefits will come from.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">It’s helpful to refer to some of the initial discussions around the design of the initial WWW and HTML to understand this. In particular, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0260.html" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">this mailing list thread</a> from 1997 proposing the addition of the <code class="jsx-4056748551">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to HTML. Marc Andreessen re-iterates the importance of serving information fast:</p><blockquote class="jsx-847609887"><p class="jsx-847609887">&quot;If a document has to be pieced together on the fly, it could get arbitrarily complex, and even if that were limited we’d certainly start experiencing major hits on performance for documents structured in this way.

Applying this as a design principle should even remove most spinners or “loading” messages from your applications. PJAX or TurboLinks miss out on opportunities to improve the perception of speed.</div></div><p class="jsx-4038270940">The first principle builds heavily on the idea of minimizing latency as the user interacts with your website.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">That said, despite how much effort you invest into minimizing the back-and-forth between server and client, there’s a few things beyond your control. A theoretical lower bound given by the distance between your user and your server being the unescapable one.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">Poor or unpredictable network quality being the other significant one. If the network connection is not great, packet re-transmission will occur.

With client-side code driving user interaction, we are now able to <em class="jsx-4160647468">mask latency</em>. We can create the perception of speed. We can artificially approach zero latency.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">Let’s consider the basic HTML web again for a second. Documents connected together through hyperlinks, or <code class="jsx-4056748551">&lt;a&gt;</code> tags. When any of them are clicked, the browser will make a network request that’ll take unpredictably long, then get and process its response and finally transition to the new state.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">JavaScript allows to <b class="jsx-4160647468">act immediately</b> and <b class="jsx-4160647468">optimistically</b> on user input. A click on a link or button can result in an immediate reaction without hitting the network. A famous example of this is Gmail (or Google Inbox), where archiving an email will happen immediately on the UI while the server request is sent and processed asynchronously.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">In the case of a form, instead of waiting for some HTML as a response after its submission, we can act right after the user presses enter. Or even better, like Google Search does, we can respond to the user holding down a key:</p><div class="jsx-2740946856 "><div class="jsx-3393864610"><img src="https://cldup.com/CmkksKRbrl.gif" class="jsx-3393864610"/></div><p class="jsx-2740946856">Google adapts its layout as soon as you hold down a key</p></div><p class="jsx-4038270940">That particular behavior is an example of what I call <em class="jsx-4160647468">layout adaptation</em>. The basic idea is that the first state of a page “knows” about the layout of the next state, so it can transition to it before there’s any data to populate the page with. It’s “optimistic” because there’s still a risk that the data never comes and an error should be displayed instead, but that’s obviously rare.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">Google’s homepage is particularly relevant to this essay because its evolution illustrates the first two principles we’ve discussed very clearly.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">First of all, analyzing the <a href="https://gist.github.com/rauchg/3e1b2d7529009370b986" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">packet dump</a> of the TCP connection to <code class="jsx-4056748551">www.google.com</code> reveals they make sure to send their entire homepage all at once after the request comes in. The whole exchange, including closing the connection, takes 64ms for me in San Francisco. This has likely been the case ever since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#mediaviewer/File:Google1998.png" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">the beginning</a>.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">In late 2004, Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2004/12/ive-got-suggestion.html" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">pioneered</a> the usage of JavaScript to provide inline as-you-type suggestions (curiously, as a 20% time project, like Gmail).

Ever since the early days, iPhone OS would request app authors to provide a <code class="jsx-4056748551">default.png</code> image that would be rendered right away, while the actual app was loading.</p><div class="jsx-2740946856 "><div class="jsx-3393864610"><img src="https://cldup.com/Gg1AwDA71S.png" class="jsx-3393864610"/></div><p class="jsx-2740946856">iPhone OS enforced loading default.png before the application</p></div><p class="jsx-4038270940">In this case, the OS was compensating not necessarily for network latency, but CPU. This was crucial considering the constraints of the original hardware. There’s however a scenario where this technique breaks. That would be when the layout doesn’t match the stored image, as in the case of login screens. A thorough analysis of its implications was provided by <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/11/11/my-default-png-dilemma" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">Marco Arment in 2010</a>.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">Another form of input besides clicks and form submissions that’s greatly enhanced by JavaScript rendering is <b class="jsx-4160647468">file input</b>.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">We can capture the user’s intent to upload through a variety of means: drag and drop, paste, file picker.

Then you modify the behavior of that component, for example, so that it produces different DOM markup for existing and new state.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">The ideal scenario is that we’re able to update the code on a per-module basis. It wouldn’t make sense to restart the socket connection, for example, if we can get away with just updating the modified component’s code. Our ideal architecture for hot-code pushing is thus <em class="jsx-4160647468">modular</em>.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">But the next challenge is that modules should be able to be re-evaluated without introducing undesirable side effects. This is where an architecture like the one proposed by <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">React</a> comes particularly handy. If a component code is updated, its logic can be trivially re-executed and the DOM efficiently updates. An exploration of this concept by Dan Abramov can be <a href="http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/" target="_blank" class="jsx-4160647468">found here</a>.</p><p class="jsx-4038270940">In essence, the idea that you <em class="jsx-4160647468">render to</em> the DOM (or <em class="jsx-4160647468">paint</em> it) is what significantly helps with hot code swapping. If state was kept in the DOM, or event listeners where set up manually by your application, updating code would become a much more complicated task.</p><div class="jsx-3001872643"><h2 style="font-weight:500;font-size:16px"><span class="jsx-3001872643"><a href="#predict-behavior" id="predict-behavior" class="jsx-3001872643">#</a></span>7.
